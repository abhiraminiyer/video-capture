# video-capture
This Python code uses the OpenCV library to capture video from a camera (specified by port number 0, typically the built-in webcam). It continuously reads frames from the video feed and adds the text "welcome to ai mi class" to each frame. The modified frame with the added text is displayed in a window named "live video." The program runs indefinitely until the 'q' key is pressed, at which point it releases the video capture and closes the OpenCV windows. This code can be used to display a live video feed with an overlaid message and exit the feed upon user input.
